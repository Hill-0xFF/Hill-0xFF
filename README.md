- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Hill-0xFF. At this moment, I'm a freelancer. Quitted my last job, after a car accident, to focus on web development and everything 
related to the topic. From simple websites to modern and mind-blowing webapps with 3D visualization.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning REACT, Django, PHP and C++. And a lot of other topics like: 3D Visualization, JS Animation, Modern UI/UX with Three.js and so on...
